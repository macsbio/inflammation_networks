In this Jupyter notebook we automated a network creation workflow for Cytoscape using the RCy3 package in R. 
This network is based on the pathways retrieved from inflammation associated genes. 
Additionally gene expression data of various disease datasets is mapped on this network, whereas based on this gene expression data subnetworks for every disease were made.
