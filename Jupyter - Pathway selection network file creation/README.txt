Acquired genes associated with inflammation were used for selection of pathways. 
Three databases were used i.e. KEGG, REACTOME and WikiPathways. 
Criteria for pathways selection was at least 10 genes in total, at least 5 genes associated with inflammation and at least 30% had to be genes associated with inflammation.
Selected pathways were used for node and edge file creation, which will be used in automated network creation in Cytoscape with the RCy3 R-package.
