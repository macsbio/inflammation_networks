In this notebook we will clean, merge and visualize the gene expression data for all disease gene sets. 
Cleaning, merging and visualizing all have their own notebook.
Gene expression data was acquired from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and TCGA. Pre-processing is described in the Data pre-processing notebook.
